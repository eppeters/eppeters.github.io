    <p>A ramsham list of books I've read. GoodReads without the bullshit. I've read it if I've read every page.</p>
<p>In early 2021 I decided to sometimes add thoughts about the books.</p>
<h2>Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems by Martin Kleppman</h2>
<p><em>Read over Christmas break 2020 through most of January, 2021</em></p>
<p>It is hard to go beyond the "intermediate" level of a
skill because the world contains so much beginner material and the rest appears so
dense we can't even approach it.</p>
<p>This book meets a
software developer in the intermediate stages of their technical
(especially distributed systems) journey and fills in gaps that make everything
so dense seem less scary, perhaps enabling them to approach more 
advanced material. I think Kleppman achieves this by keeping the
material abstract. While he refers to specific tools throughout the book, his
focus is on the ideas, motivations, and goals behind the tools. Most tools
are mentioned in groups of other tools that address similar problems. I came
away from the book feeling ready to analyze the next unfamiliar 
tool in terms of its ideas, motivations, and goals using familiar concepts.</p>
<p>Caveat: It's implicit in the title, but this book
probably won't
do anything for your understanding of hardcore number-crunching, except maybe
round out your world view. It's also not a book for beginners. But even if you've
used multiple relational SQL database systems, NoSQL
databases, any distributed data store, or even if you've read about them a lot,
even if you know tons of features of these products and know how to configure
them, chances are that, unless you've had some kind of formal training, you
have not been able to look at those tools from such fundamental points of view
as Martin Kleppman shows his readers. Why are relational databases so popular?
How have they evolved? How can we explain subtleties between their transaction models? What even is a transaction, fundamentally, and what is the idea's history?
Why does AWS behave so differently than software of yore? Exactly what kinds of problems are
the authors of my favorite complex software trying to solve, at bottom? This isn't
really a technical manual type of book. It answers questions like "Big data is
popular, but what the hell is it and why did anyone even come up with it?"</p>
<p>This
book deals with big, fundamental concepts that are <em>almost</em> directly applicable
to practical everyday software engineering. You'll read this, and while you
won't know how to install or use some new software, you'll start seeing the
book's ideas and patterns seemingly <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
