<h1>What Have I Actually Done at My Current Job?</h1>
<p>If I sat down to work on my resume any day but today, I would probably forget
that I was the one who managed much of our development team's Omniture
integrations at Truth Initiative Innovations.</p>
<p>Why not create a long-lived, long-updated post that lists out these lesser
remembered things, and maybe even some of the morer remembered things?</p>
<p>When it's time to sit down in front of the resume etching machine, I will be ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 10-14-2020, my dev lead/acting supervisor said:<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for handling the deploy stuff and the details for [client]
You very consistently handle this sort of “getting the end of a project
wrangled and live” well, and it’s been a huge load off knowing you have it</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>I managed the Omniture Integrations at Truth Initiative Innovations. This
  includes classifying variables, being the person who knows the stuff about
  how Omniture works on the team (e.g. I was one of the two people who could
  remind people what evars and sprops were), and I'd take point on
  troubleshooting wiley Omniture bugs (like - why wasn't some registration data
  getting associated with a "person" in Jive, yet other stuff apparently was?).</li>
<li>At one point, I created a webhook-based system to receive and report page view
    events to external partners who were paying for that data.</li>
<li>For a long while, our servers were locking up because of blocking connections
  to our centralized (cloud) logging provider, and when the server came back
  online (usually after a hard reboot through the console at the datacenter),
  we would have lost all logs during that period. I fixed this by investigating
  our rsyslog config and improving it to not drop these messages when the
  logging provider was unavailable, and also to not block incoming syslog
  messages during this period, thus avoiding server lockups altogether. We went
  from "Oh my god we had better restart rsyslog soon or the server will crash"
  to "Oh look, we got an alert that rsyslog is experiencing connection
  problems. It will eventually come back online and send our logs to the
  logging provider." Because of this blocking and a less than great <code>rsyslog</code>
  configuration, our local syslog server would block applications' socket
  connections on the <code>/dev/log</code> socket, and since many important processes
  (such as <code>sshd</code>!) submitted syslog messages at this location, many processes
  on the server locked up.</li>
<li>Created an import mechanism for semi-technical business personnel to compose
  SMS text message conversations. This involves composing a series of messages,
  recognized regexes, responses, and API integrations as an artifact that can
  be uploaded to multiple environments and tested before going to production.
  This was an improvement from the method of filling out HTML forms for each
  message and saving them in an instance/environment's DB state with no easy
  way to replicate this in other environments. In short, I created an artifact
  format for non-developers to use as a better interface for creating text
  message conversations.</li>
<li>Used a couple of Kibana cloud solutions daily to debug production issues and
  alert on them. Also often led the charge to seriously log as much as
  humanly/computerly possible in our apps to allow future observability. I
  wanted people to be able to find the exact code line and related data (db
  rows, etc.) needed to debug an issue, just by looking at the error log.</li>
<li>Built development, staging, and production, as well as CI, infrastructure on
  AWS EC2/RDS with Ansible and Jenkins as well as Heroku and Heroku CI. Also
  built development infra on Docker (with and without Docker Compose) and
  Vagrant with Ansible.</li>
<li>Architected a move from managed multi-server, multi-app VPS hosting to AWS,
  adding load balancing into the mix for the first time for the application.
  Automated all AWS infrastructure creation/management in Ansible.</li>
<li>Designed a test interface for message library admins to simulate user
  experiences so they could gain confidence that their text messaging programs
  would work as expected for various users up to 90 days in the future.</li>
