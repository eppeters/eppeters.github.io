<h1>Debugging an Inteference Problem on My uBitx v6</h1>
<p>I got my uBitx v6 recently from
<a href="https://www.hfsignals.com/index.php/ubitx-v6/">hfsignals</a> and hooked it up to
a 20m/40m trapped dipole from <a href="http://qrpkits.com/dualbanddipole.html">Pacific
Antenna</a>, mounted about 30 ft off the
ground as an inverted vee.</p>
<p>So far I've made no contacts and been able to hear only one half of an SSB
conversation that sounded like it was coming from somewhere near me in
Virginia. I've been able to hear some digital modes and very small bursts (a
couple of letters) of CW on occasion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately everywhere I tune on my radio sounds like intense static garbage
- a problem I'm assuming for now is QRM that can be removed. In other words, I
don't think it's coming from inside the radio. (I have a couple of reasons for
this - mainly that when I unplug the antenna or put a large resistive load on
the antenna connector, the static is gone.)</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Manifests as a crackly static</li>
<li>Occurs across all bands</li>
<li>Has so far only allowed geographically close reception (possibly indicating
  desensitization of signals that aren't extremely strong, or maybe my antenna
  is accidentally an NVIS antenna?)</li>
<li>Gets much, much more aggressive (louder) as I go down in frequency</li>
<li>Does not improve when all devices in the house are off except the radio's
  switching 12V power supply - I haven't yet tried on batteries alone</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible causes</h2>
<ul>
<li>RFI from the 12V switching power supply I got on
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01461MOGQ/">Amazon</a></li>
<li>RFI from a neighbor's electronic device(s)</li>
<li>Power line interference</li>
<li>Some form of coupling or common mode current (I'm way out of my depth here in
  terms of understanding, but my station is ungrounded and I am not using a
  balun on my inverted vee)</li>
<li>Some problem caused by an incorrectly installed BNC connector on my coax
  cable. I feel pretty OK with my stripping and crimping job, but these were a
  couple of the first BNC connectors I ever crimped onto the end of a coax
  cable, so maybe I caused some problem?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Video of interference</h2>
<p>Below is a video with audio of the interference. I switch across the bands to
show that the interference is extremely wide banded.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR2Hp0X5kww">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR2Hp0X5kww</a></p>
<h2>Interesting detail</h2>
<p>If I connect an alligator clip from a 160 foot piece of RG8X cable I have lying
in a coil nearby, the static gets much more intense. Not sure if this could be
a clue to what the problem is, but if so, I have no idea how.</p>
<h2>How I Fixed It</h2>
<p>I didn't yet, but I did figure out what was causing the problem. I realized
that the last step to rule out my own house's devices from the list of possible
causes was to run the ubitx on battery power with all my home power turned off.
I didn't have a 12V battery or battery pack, so I wired one up using 8 alkaline AA batteries I had lying around, and voila - no
static whatsoever. Interestingly after play with the radio for a while, I did
notice that the cheap LED grow lights I use for my tomatoes and peppers create
strong interference, but they're close to the radio and easy to turn off
temporarily.</p>
<p>After eliminating the RFI, I immediately heard the Russian station <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/R2OA">R2OA</a> coming through on 14.203 MHz SSB during the <a href="http://www.rdxc.org/asp/pages/rulesg.asp">Russian DX contest</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, some AAs from the store are going to last less than an hour. My long-term solution to the switching power supply issue is to buy one made for radio use, like <a href="https://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-4225MV">this one by MFJ</a>.</p>
